Context provides a way to pass data or state through the component tree without having to pass props down manually through each nested component. 
It is designed to share data that can be considered as global data for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user or theme(e.g. color, paddings, margins, font-sizes).

Syntax:

            const authContext = useContext(initialValue);


The useContext accepts the value provided by React.createContext and then re-render the component whenever its value changes but you can still optimize its performance by using memoization.
