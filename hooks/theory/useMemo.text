The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.
It is very useful in optimizing the performance of a React component by eliminating repeating heavy computations.
The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.

Syntax:
        const memoizedValue = useMemo(functionThatReturnsValue, arrayDepencies)
