The useLayoutEffect works similarly to useEffect but rather working asynchronously like useEffect hook, it fires synchronously after all DOM loading is done loading.
This is useful for synchronously re-rendering the DOM and also to read the layout from the DOM. 
But to prevent blocking the page loading, we should always use useEffect hook.
Updates scheduled inside useLayoutEffect will be flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint.

*** Prefer the standard useEffect when possible to avoid blocking visual updates.
Syntax:

        useLayoutEffect()
